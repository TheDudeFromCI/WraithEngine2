# WraithEngine2
A newer version of WraithEngine, started on January 20th, 2016.

WraithEngine is a game engine, desgined to help users to create awesome games, very quickly. It takes out most of the work when it comes to level design, and programming, so you only have to worry about the core itself.

Although called "WraithEngine2". it's still technically the first one. The original WraithEngine I developed turned out to be more like a library, rather than an actual engine. It also was poorly developed, and highly buggy. I called this one "WraithEngine2" as to seperate this version from the old one. You can ignore the "2" at the end. The program itself is only called "WraithEngine".

# What Is It?
WraithEngine is an open sourced, game development engine, used to aid indie developers to make games. This project is designed more as a fun project, rather than a robust, professional-grade editor, such as some of the well known engines out there. It is being developed by a much smaller community, with features being added on a supply and demand basis. If you wish to play with it, go ahead and grab the newest release from above, and have fun.

# Requirements
Currently, the only requirements for running WraithEngine is Java 1.8 or higher, and OpenGL 3.0 or higher. All other libraries are loading inside of the program file. Runs on all major operating systems, where Java 1.8 is supported.

OpenGL is supported by almost all modern computers, and graphics cards now. So it's safe to assume you have it if your computer was built within the last five years. It's also safe to assume most of your target market owns it if they are gamers.

Java 1.8+ is still a growing runtime environment, and may not be supported by many users. Eventually WraithEngine will come with a self contained Java version for development, and deployment.

# Installation
At the moment, the installtion process is simply downloading the jar file to your desktop, and double clicking it. All internal files are installed to a folder called "WraithEngine" in your home directory. This setup will become more flexible and user friendly in the future.

# Can I Use It?
You may freely use this software for your own projects. Both commerical, or private use is fine. Have fun. You may also edit the code to fit your needs if you wish. My only requirement is that in any games you make with WraithEngine, you keep the WraithEngine splash logo at startup. You can add your own splash before or after it, as long as you don't remove that one. I have put a lot of hard work into this engine. Please don't abuse it.

Other than that, have fun. I encourage you to make awesome stuff, and have a ton of fun doing it. If you're an indie game developer, good luck with your game! I hope it sells well.

# Can I Help?
Yes, but not right now. Right now, as it is still very early in development, I wish to work on it until it becomes more stable. Once the project becomes more contained, I will start accepting pull requests. Simply star and/or watch this project, and you should be notified when it's fully ready of public editing.

Please note, when public editing is available, I still may not accept every pull request, if it appears to damage the system, or create potential harm.
